  title: About Code for New Orleans
---
Code for New Orleans is a group of local volunteers focused on making city services accessible and easy to use and improving the lives of residents.

We're a brigade of [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/), a national non-profit focused on civic activism with technology in local contexts across our nation.

## Events
We meet monthly on the second Thursday of the month at 7:00 PM for Project Nights at Launch Pad on Poydras Street.

In addition, we host bigger events for days of action:

* National Day of Civic Hacking
* CodeAcross
* CityCamp
* International Open Data Day
