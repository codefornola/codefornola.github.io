    goals:
      - Scrape court dockets off the Plaquemines Parish Court website
      - View and compare court cases across multiple years
      - The scraper starts at January 20th of the desired year, rather than the 1st. We don't know why.
    skills_needed:
      - Ruby
    why: |
      The Plaquemines Parish Court website lets you search for court dockets on [its website](https://cotthosting.com/laplaquemines/User/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2flaplaquemines%2fLandRecords%2fprotected%2fSrchQuickName.aspx), but you cannot download them in bulk. This scraper allows you to run analysis on the cases they handle and their outcomes.
    where: |
      The court dockets can be searched at [https://cotthosting.com/laplaquemines/User/Login.aspx](https://cotthosting.com/laplaquemines/User/Login.aspx).
      
      The scraper code is [on Github](https://github.com/lgants/SamanthaScrape).
