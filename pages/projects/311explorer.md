## Why?

The 311 Explorer is a project aimed at making city services more visible to citizens.

The city regularly publishes data on city services execution and performance, known as 311 data, after the phone number used to call in requests for such services.

## What?

This project has the following goals:

* Review and understand 311 data structure and content
* Identify problems with published data and work with the city to remediate them
* Build queries on the data to help present it in ways that make it easier to understand
* Build a map-based explorer interface to interact with the data dynamically in aggregate
* Build a web-based search interface to be able to look up specific interests or issues easily

## Where?

City 311 data is located on [data.nola.gov](https://data.nola.gov/City-Administration/311-Calls-2012-Present-/3iz8-nghx).

The city's 311 Explorer app (which we hope this will be more useful than) is at [311explorer.nola.gov](http://311explorer.nola.gov/main/category/).

The code for this project is on Github in the [codefornola/311 repo](https://github.com/codefornola/311).
