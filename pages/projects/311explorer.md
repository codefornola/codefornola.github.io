    why: |
      The 311 Explorer is a project aimed at making city services more visible to citizens.

      The city regularly publishes data on city services execution and performance, known as 311 data, after the phone number used to call in requests for such services.
    where: |
      City 311 data is located on [data.nola.gov](https://data.nola.gov/City-Administration/311-Calls-2012-Present-/3iz8-nghx).

      The city's 311 Explorer app (which we hope this will be more useful than) is at [311explorer.nola.gov](http://311explorer.nola.gov/main/category/).

      The code for this project is on Github in the [codefornola/311 repo](https://github.com/codefornola/311).
