    goals:
      - Provide a one-stop shop for all information about Code for New Orleans, up-to-date with the people, projects and events we're working on.
    skills_needed:
      - Content creation
      - Writing and editing
      - User experience
      - Visual design
      - Jekyll/Liquid template scripting
    why: |
      Code for New Orleans is a loose group of volunteers, and folks are often interested in taking part in what we do. However, at the moment, there's nowhere to go to learn about what we're doing and what they might do to help us. Information that is available is scattered across several sites.
    where: |
      The current site used to exist at [http://codeforneworleans.org](http://codeforneworleans.org), but that DNS is not working at the moment. The old site design still exists at [https://codefornola.github.io/](https://codefornola.github.io/) while we work on the new site.

      The code for this project is on Github in the [codefornola/codefornola.github.io](https://github.com/codefornola/codefornola.github.io).
