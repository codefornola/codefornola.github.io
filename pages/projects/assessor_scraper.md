    goals:
      - Scrape, capture and transform New Orleans tax assessment data from the city website into a form more suited for bulk data analysis.
    skills_needed:
      - Data analysis
      - Visualization design
      - Website scraping
      - Legal understanding
    why: |
      New Orleans tax assessment data is extraordinarily difficult to retrieve from the city website, and the city office charges a fee for bulk extracts due to the burden of extracting that data from their systems.

      In order to make this data more accessible, we aim to take on the burden of extracting, assembling and transforming that data through a web scraper tool in order to make bulk data analysis possible.
    where: |
      Assessor data can be retrieved through the search tool available at  [nolaassessor.com](http://nolaassessor.com/).

      The code for this project is on Github in the [codefornola/assessor-scraper repo](https://github.com/codefornola/assessor-scraper).
